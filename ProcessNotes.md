# Process Notes

*Brainstorm*

- I tried opening Twine but my game wasn’t there…I don’t know where it went
- When I search “Laura Secord” into my search bar the link comes up…anyways I found my Twine game
- Started with the basics and figured out that I wanted a Candy Land type board for the game. I thought at first Monopoly but that is a lot of effort and a lot more thinking then really needs to go into a game designed for children.
I figured since children learn about the War of 1812 in elementary school around grade 5, I wanted to create a game that was easy. Even if that something they could play in grades 1 or 2 then they would be excited to learn about this story in the future.
- The best game design would have been like a circuit board and each character could start at one spot and work through the challenges based on that character and then end up at Beaverdams. In hindsight that would have been a much better board to design BUT candy land works.
- I created the board first with symbols and each time you landed on a symbol you got a card that matched but then I thought that was too easy. So therefore, every time you land you get to pick up a card that nobody sees. This game combines Catan and Ticket to Ride (both excellent board games which I totally recommend).
- I designed the board and cards using “Canva” an online source that is free and allows you to download the materials you have created for free as well. 
- I used a blank “A4” design and coloured the background light green. Simply click the “background” icon on the left right side and then change the colour there. 
- I then added a heading text by clicking “text” and chose the font “Coustard” and make it size 56. 
- The small dots around the board were chosen from “Shapes” under the category “Elements”. I chose the grey circle with the white trimming around it. Then I coloured the whole thing one colour anyways so the first circle would work fine. I chose this circle because originally I had the outside one colour and the inside white with a coloured icon. 
- To find the flag icon I simply searched in the search bar at the top of the elements category for a flag. It is easy to resize, drag and copy icons. 
- I also create the “place deck here” images using Elements<Shapes and using the white square with grey thing outline. The grey is replaced with whatever colour background you have on your paper so here it turned out green. 
- I downloaded the page from the top right hand corner and saved it as a PDF.
- I then started creating the cards for the game.
- The adventure cards are made using the same shape that was used to make the “place deck here” square. It can be located under Elements in Shapes. The adventure cards are coloured differently but do not serve a purpose unless you would like to make the game more difficult. The icons are important as they represent the walking (since Laura Secord walked a long ways to warn the British about an American attack)
- The danger cards are only the cards you pick up when you land on a flag. These are the cards that make things harder and set you back in the game.
- I wanted to make these pretty simple for the children but also realistic as if these things were to happen in real life then there would be a consequence. 
- The difficulty cards were created last because I wanted to make the game harder. These are named after actual Laura Secord chocolate so I think there may be some copy right issues here.
- The character cards are what each person would get to pick at the start and then they would need a game piece to play on the board. I think a little miniature ice cream cone with different coloured ice cream would be fun and kids would like it.
- It was hard to balance the history and the entertainment portion and direct it towards kids. I think a different board would have made it a lot better but overall I would play this game.
- Overall, this was a very simple module to create physically. I think the thought behind it took longer to actually figure out how the game would physically work and if people would find it enjoyable.
