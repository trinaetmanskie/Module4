# Understanding the Modules 

Module 4 was a way to tie together all the semester’s work and consider the changes that have been made since the start of the semester. Although we have our portfolio coming up, this module was the final piece to our projects. We started the semester with scanning an object and then creating a 3D model. Perhaps I should have done a model of a box of chocolates but the War of 1812 model was a wonderful start. I then took the decimal locations from the battle grounds and sonified that into a 10 second song. For the third module, getting more in depth, I decided to truly dive into the War of 1812 and write about Laura Secord. Thus, in the last module I recreated the Twine game from module 3 but as a board game. 

I wanted to create something that would allow me to use it in the future but as well relate to the career I wish to follow and that is teaching. I remember learning about the War of 1812 as a child but that is it. I created this board game so that it is geared towards children and allowing them to better understand the story of Laura Secord. However, I do not think I did as best as I could.

# The Importance of Module 4

The importance of replicas and recreating is keeping the meaning and reminding people of the significance of the original. Although I have created a board game that works and is fun for children I do not think I am doing Laura Secord justice. Considering the readings we had for module 4, we looked at the Triumphal Arch Palmyra in Trafalgar Square that was recreated. The press tore up the model because it did not match the flowers from the first model. This is interesting to me because that reminds me of how we should be with ourselves. If we are going to go to the effort to recreate something and make a copy of an object then we need to be willing to put in the time and effort that was put into the original. Although a replica is not as authentic or not from that time, it still needs to be signifiant of something. 

This module was different because we were able to do many things with it. I decided to create something brand new that was significant of something old. I was not restoring but recreating. I was in many ways preserving the story of Laura Secord by retelling this story through my own version. This is quite different than 3D printing an object because when one is 3D printing an object they are physically recreating something in perhaps an identical form or what that is original but can be directly related to another object. With a board game however, it looks nothing like the first module that I created. The reading discusses the idea, of “separating the task of preservation from that of restoration” (Kamash 2017). Digitally restoring and digitally preserving objects are two very different things. With this module we were able to do both in some aspects. My board game does not restore anything but a 3D printing from someone else may be able to.

# Working with the Game

I designed a game that was for 2-5 players ages 5+. This simple board game allows players to travel around the board collecting items in hopes to be the first to win. My intention and hope was that it allows children to play the game and become curious about the story of Laura Secord. She is a national female icon who did something amazing during the war but is mainly remembered because of ice cream. I think using the notion of ice cream to entice children and draw them in will open the doors for many learning moments. 

# How it was done

I used Canva, a free online source, to create the board game. I created a simple board that was colourful and vibrant. Often when thinking of the war it is easy to be desolate and despair and hear sad stories. Secord’s story is quite a different tale than that and I wanted the board to reflect this. 

I wanted to create the cards to be clear cut and easy to understand. I wanted to create the appearance that although history is vast and big it can still be easy to understand. With this module and game I was able to simplify something but still keep the importance of it.

# Final Thoughts

My final thoughts come from an article in module 3. Authors Kee and Graham discuss history within games and explain, “The challenge for historians is that, with a few notable exceptions, history games are not created by researchers focused on learning; they are built by gamers obsessed with fun.” (Graham 273). I was very challenged when creating this game. I was struggling to include all the details but keep the game fun. I chose to eliminate some of the history and reside on more of the fun aspect of the game and that is where the issue comes in. This game is lacking in historic details and fails to provide and do justice to Laura Secord. Although I wish to say that I did attempt to do so, there is much more that can be fixed. In order to really do justice to something as historic and important, more time and effort needs to go into fixing all the small details. Although this is not a replica of an object, it still needs to scream for authenticity and uphold to the standard of the original.
